                                You signify your agreement to (1) these terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service"),
                                (2) Gong's Privacy Policy, found at <a href="www.Gongtalent.com/privacy">www.Gongtalent.com/privacy</a> and incorporated herein by reference.

                                modify or revise the Terms of Service at any time, and You agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions

                                Businesses and organizations pay us to show you ads for their products and services.
                                <b>By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think will be relevant to you and your interests.</b>
                                We use your personal data to help determine which ads to show you. We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers,
                                and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information)
                                with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things
                                like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested.
                                We provide advertisers with reports about the
                                performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content.

                                you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored content:</u>
                                You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions
                                you have taken on Gong next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored content
                                that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example,
                                we may show your fans that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a
                                Business created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Gong. Ads like this can be seen only by people
                                who have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Gong.
                                You can adjust your ad settings and preferences.

                                we do not review all User Content, and we take no responsibility for the User Content that appears on
                                the Service. User Content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that Posts the User Content.
                                As reflected in these Terms and in our Community Guidelines, we have no tolerance for Objectionable Content,
                                and we do not want our Service put to any improper use, but we cannot guarantee that all User Content will
                                always conform to these Terms. If you encounter any Objectionable Content on the Service, please immediately
                                email Gong Support here. Gong provides you with the ability to report Objectionable Content as a courtesy,

                                to any Objectionable Content on the Service that you report to Gong.

                                in its sole discretion. In addition, Gong has the right—but not the obligation—in its sole discretion to remove or delete

                                Community Guidelines. Gong recommends that you save copies of any User Content

                        <p>
                            Users on Gong can enjoy the benefits of earning money and receiving payments by receiving tips
                            on the Gong platform as well as also selling their own original content and materials.
                            Gong will charge a 10% platform fee for such transactions that are conducted through Gong. This percentage is
                            also subject to change and may be updated at a later date. The payments received by the end user may also
                            receive a deduction in fees that are necessary in order to carry out the transaction. For instance, on iOS,
                            apple charges a 30% fee for in-app purchases towards receiving tips. Therefore, the end user would receive
                            the amount after 30% has been deducted from Apple and 10% from Gong leaving the user with 60% of the original tip.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For marketplace transactions, Gong will again charge 10% per transaction.
                            The user might also face additional fees by the merchant payment processor.
                            The user will receive the difference of the total amount paid, any credit card fees
                            and Gong’s 10% platform fee.

If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the District Court of Denton County of Denton, TX. You and Gong Inc. consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.
