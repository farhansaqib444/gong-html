                <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Users on Gong can enjoy the benefits of earning money and receiving payments by receiving tips on the Gong platform as well as also selling their own original content and materials. Gong will charge a 10% platform fee for such transactions that are conducted through Gong. This percentage is also subject to change and may be updated at a later date. The payments received by the end user may also receive a deduction in fees that are necessary in order to carry out the transaction. For instance, on iOS, apple charges a 30% fee for in-app purchases towards receiving tips. Therefore, the end user would receive the amount after 30% has been deducted from Apple and 10% from Gong leaving the user with 60% of the original tip.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">For marketplace transactions, Gong will again charge 10% per transaction. The user might also face additional fees by the merchant payment processor. The user will receive the difference of the total amount paid, any credit card fees and Gong&rsquo;s 10% platform fee.</span>
